# 📘 Assignment: Hangman Game Challenge

## 🎯 Objective

Build the classic Hangman word-guessing game to practice string manipulation, loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Implement Hangman

#### Description
Create a command-line Hangman game in Python that randomly selects words and lets a player guess letters until they either reveal the word or run out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list.
- Accept single-letter guesses and display current progress in the "_ _ _" format.
- Track and display remaining incorrect guesses.
- End the game with a win message when the word is fully guessed, or a lose message when attempts are exhausted.
- Be reasonably user-friendly (clear prompts and status updates).

You can base your solution on `starter-code.py` in this folder.
